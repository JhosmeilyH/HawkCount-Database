# HawkCount-Database

The HawkCount Database project serves as a valuable resource for birdwatchers, researchers, and conservationists, offering insights into bird behavior and population trends. By leveraging real-world data from the HawkCount Database website and employing advanced database management and analysis techniques, this project contributes to the understanding and preservation of avian species. This project not only allowed me to apply database management and SQL skills but also provided a unique opportunity to work with real-world data from the HawkCount Database website
